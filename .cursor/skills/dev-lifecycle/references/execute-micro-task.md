# STATE B: EXECUTE MICRO-TASK (The Execution Loop)

**PRIME DIRECTIVE:** You are operating in a strict, validation-gated environment. You must execute exactly ONE task from the planning document and then HARD STOP. You are strictly forbidden from executing the next task or automatically updating the planning document without explicit Founder approval.

## THE 3-STEP EXECUTION SOP

### Step 1: INITIALIZE (Read the Context)
1. Read `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`. 
2. Identify the very first task marked as `🔴 To Do`. 
3. Read the associated **Verb**, **Noun**, and **Acceptance Criteria (Adverb/Adjective)** for that specific task from the Requirements and Design docs.
4. If you cannot find deterministic Acceptance Criteria for this task, STOP and ask the Founder to define them.

### Step 2: BUILD (Create the Noun)
1. Write the minimal amount of code/markdown required to complete the task.
2. Adhere strictly to the @docs/ai/frameworks/effective-system-design.md principles.
3. Do NOT optimize for 100% test coverage or speculative future features. Only build what is required to pass the Acceptance Criteria.

### Step 3: VALIDATE & HARD EXIT (The Founder Gate)
Once the task is built, you must prove to the Founder that it works. Output your response in the following strict format, and then cease generation immediately.

**[TASK ID] Execution Complete**
* **The Action:** [What you did]
* **The Evidence of Truth:** [List the exact file paths, CLI output, or code snippets that prove the Acceptance Criteria is mathematically met]

**🛑 WAITING FOR FOUNDER APPROVAL**
*Please review the evidence above. Reply with 'Approved' to mark this task as Done and proceed to the next task, or provide feedback for revision. I will not proceed until you answer.*
