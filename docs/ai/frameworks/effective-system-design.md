# Effective System Design Framework (Approach 2: Success = Efficient and Scalable management of failure risks)

The Prime Directive: Never propose a technical solution / user enablement (Noun) or write code until the causal reality of the User's system is fully mapped. Software is simply a tool to manipulate human workflows, drivers, and blockers.

When executing the "Understanding Requirements" phase, you must sequentially complete the following three phases:

Phase 1: Problem Discovery (The System Map)
Goal: Understand the human reality before introducing technology.

Ultimate Desired Outcome (UDO): The fundamental, non-technical state the user is trying to achieve (e.g., "Effortless weight management", not "A calorie counting app").

User's Action: The action that the User is trying to take to reach that UDO

The Drivers (UDS - Ultimate Driving System): The conscious system of forces pushing the user toward the UDO.

UDS.UD (Driver of the Driver): The root driver that ultimately causes the UDS to succeed (it could be internal (biological/psychological if the user is human, or external))

UDS.UB (Blocker of the Driver): The root blocker that ultimately makes this driver fail (it could be internal (biological/psychological if the user is human, or external forces)).

The Blockers (UBS - Ultimate Blocking System): The conscious system of forces stopping the User from reaching the UDO.

UBS.UD (Driver of the Blocker): What ultimately causes the UBS to succeed in blocking the User? (it could be internal to the User or external to them).

UBS.UB (Blocker of the Blocker): What ultimately blocks the UBS from affecting the User? (it could be internal to the User or external to them).

Since each of the above is a system in itself (General System = User + Action + Action Desired Outcome + UBS + UDS + Principles + Environment + Tools + SOP), we must further understand the below

Phase 2: The System Design (The Context & Bridge)
Goal: Define the conceptual solution space based ONLY on what we understand about the User in Phase 1.

Principles (Why): What general, scientific Principles that each driver (UDS.UD / UBS.UB) is governed by? And what general, scientific Principles that each of the Blockers (UBS.UD / UDS.UB) is governed by? (One Principle for each)

Environment (Where): Based strictly on the Principles above, where MUST the solution / enablement live to be most effective, that amplifies the Drivers and disable the Blockers? (Physical, Digital or Cultural environments).

Tools (What): The conceptual mechanism of Tools that is based strictly on the Principles and Environment above. Tools must be Physical, Digital and Cultural to fit in the Environment.

Desirable Wrapper: The hook that gets them to use it.

Effective Core: The hidden mechanic that actually solves the root drivers and/or root blockers

SOP (How): The step-by-step action by the User that leverages the Tools and the Environment with strict respect to the Principles that promise highest confidence level in reaching their Ultimate Desired Outcome

Phase 3: The Formalization (The Output)
Goal: Translate the System Design into strict, deterministic engineering requirements.

1. USER(S): [Define detailed User Persona and Anti-Persona (Who is not the User)]
* **Primary User Persona:** [Detailed description]
* **Anti-Persona:** [Who is explicitly NOT the user]    

2. DESIRED USER ACTION(S): All Acceptance Criteria must be as MECE as possible

Verb: [The core action to achieve the UDO]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Verb]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Verb]
Acceptance Criteria N: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Verb]

Adverbs (The Effectiveness Outcomes - What the UDO comprises of):

Sustainability Adverb: [Risk/Safety outcomes, e.g., "Correctly", "Securely", "Deterministically"]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Sustainability Adverb]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Sustainability Adverb]
Acceptance Criteria N: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Sustainability Adverb]

Efficiency Adverb: [Speed/Utility outcomes, e.g., "Incrementally" "Frugally", "Surgically"]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adverb]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adverb]
Acceptance Criteria N: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adverb]

Scalability Adverb: [Growth outcomes, e.g., "Repeatedly", "Comparatively"]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adverb]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adverb]
Acceptance Criteria N: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adverb]

3. FEATURE:

Noun: [The specific Tool built for the User to execute the Verb in the prescribed Environment respecting the Principles]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Noun]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Noun]
Acceptance Criteria N: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Noun]

Adjectives The attributes of the Noun (Features) that best enable the Users to take Action reaching the above Effectiveness Outcomes (Adverb)

Sustainability Adjective: [e.g., "Encrypted", "Offline-first"]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Sustainability Adjective]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Sustainability Adjective]

Efficiency Adjective: [e.g., "Automated", "Lightweight"]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adjective]
Acceptance Criteria 2: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adjective]
Acceptance Criteria N: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Efficiency Adjective]

Scalability Adjective: [e.g., "Modular", "API-driven"]

Acceptance Criteria 1: [Measurement of Acceptance for the Scalability Adjective]
