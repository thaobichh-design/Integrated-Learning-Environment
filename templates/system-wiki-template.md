### 3.3. THE EFFECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF THIS SYSTEM

**Instructions**: Principles should arrive pre-labeled from ESD (see `effective-system-design.md` §4.1). Each principle is labeled with its S/E/Sc pillar: `P[n](S)`, `P[n](E)`, `P[n](Sc)`. List them below, grouped by pillar with 2 sub-categories per pillar. These principles must be derived from your analysis of the UBS and UDS above and trace directly to how this system disables blockers or enables drivers.

**Principle Label Format**: `P1(S)`, `P2(S)`, `P3(E)`, `P4(Sc)`, etc. — where the letter indicates the Effectiveness pillar.

| PILLAR & LABEL | PURPOSE OF PRINCIPLES | PRINCIPLE NAME & DESCRIPTION | IMPORTANT NOTES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SUSTAINABILITY (S)** | Minimize failure risks | `[ e.g., P1(S): "Principle of Redundancy: No single point of failure." ]` | These principles disable/avoid the following: Combined Root Failure Principles (UBS.UD + UBS.UD.UD + UBS.UB.UB + UDS.UB + UDS.UB.UD + UBS.UD.UB), and the root Failure Principles (UBS). |
| | Produce desired outcomes | `[ e.g., P2(S): "Principle of Auditability: All decisions leave a traceable record." ]` | |
| **EFFICIENCY (E)** | De-risk at current resources | `[ e.g., P3(E): "Principle of Standardization: Do it once, use it many times." ]` | These principles enable/utilize the following: Root Success Principles (UDS.UD + UDS.UD.UD + UDS.UB.UB + UBS.UB + UBS.UD.UB + UBS.UB.UD), and the root Success Principles (UDS). |
| | Maximize outputs at current resources | `[ e.g., P4(E): "Principle of Automation: Automate low-value tasks to free up human time." ]` | |
| **SCALABILITY (Sc)** | De-risk gains at growth | `[ e.g., P5(Sc): "Principle of Systems over Heroes: Build processes that survive staff turnover." ]` | These principles enable scalability at recursive UDS layers. |
| | Output gains at growth | `[ e.g., P6(Sc): "Principle of Self-Service: Enable users to help themselves via self-service tools." ]` | |


### 3.4. CORE VALUES FOR THIS SYSTEM

`[` `**Instructions**: Explicitly map this system to LTC’s Five Principles found in the Handbook. ]`

- **Ethics Above All:** `[ How does this system ensure we "do what's right"? e.g., "Whistleblower protection is built-in." ]`
- **Effectiveness Over Efficiency:** `[ How does this system prioritize "doing it better" (effectiveness) over just "doing it fast" (efficiency)? ]`
- **Transparency, Open Minds, and Open Communication:** `[ How does this system foster psychological safety and information sharing? ]`
- **Collective Leadership:** `[ How does this system ensure "no single person dominates" and diverse voices are heard? ]`
- **Continuous Improvement:** `[ How does this system learn from mistakes (e.g., Post-Mortem Reviews)? ]`

### 4.1. EFFECTIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

**Design Source**: Derived from ESD Phase 2 §4.2 (Environment).

**Classification Note**: Environment types below (Physical/Digital/Cultural/Other) describe the **KIND** of environment. These are orthogonal to ESD's UES causal layers (Foundational/Operational/Enhancement), which describe **DEPENDENCY ORDER**. Both classifications are useful: environment types for operational documentation (this wiki), causal layers for design methodology (ESD).

### **6.1. PROCEDURE & RESPONSIBILITIES**

`[` `**Instructions**: Detail the step-by-step process. You must strictly separate steps that "Minimize Failure Risks" (Sustainability) from steps that "Optimize Output" (Efficiency). This ensures the "Ultimate Blocking System" (UBS) identified in Section 3 is systematically neutralized before the "Ultimate Driving System" (UDS) is deployed. ]`
`[` `**Critical**: Use the RACI model. Map every step to a specific "System ID" (e.g., [OPS HR]) to ensure clear ownership. ]`
